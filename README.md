# ipverse-tools

This repository contains tools that enable you to work with the ipverse data, a comprehensive database of IP addresses and associated metadata. These tools provide functionality 
for querying, analyzing, and visualizing the data to gain insights into network activity and security threats.

## Crowdsec

The `crowdsec` folder includes tools for working with Crowdsec, an open-source, lightweight software that detects and prevents peers with aggressive behaviors from 
accessing your systems. It uses a combination of behavior analysis and reputation scoring to identify and block malicious IP addresses, brute force attacks, and other types of 
malicious activity.
