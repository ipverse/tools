# ipverse-tools

This repository contains example scripts for working with ipverse data. They are meant as a starting point and are not actively maintained or supported.

## ip2as

The `ip2as` folder contains a Python CLI tool that does the reverse of [as-ip-blocks](https://github.com/ipverse/as-ip-blocks): given an IP address, find which AS it belongs to. Uses the as-ip-blocks data, supports IPv4/IPv6, and needs nothing beyond Python 3.

## crowdsec

The `crowdsec` folder includes tools for working with Crowdsec, an open-source, lightweight software that detects and prevents peers with aggressive behaviors from
accessing your systems. It uses a combination of behavior analysis and reputation scoring to identify and block malicious IP addresses, brute force attacks, and other types of
malicious activity.
